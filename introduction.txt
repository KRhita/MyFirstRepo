Brief Introduction About Myself
My name is Rhita, and I am a learner in the ALX program with an interest in technology and continuous learning. I am currently developing my skills in Git and GitHub to better manage projects and collaborate with others.
This repository is part of my learning journey as I build strong foundations in version control and software development.
